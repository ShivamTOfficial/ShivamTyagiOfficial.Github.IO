						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>Hi, I am Shivam Tyagi. I enjoy problem solving (finding & even creating someðŸ™‚)
							<br> Ahem... they seem to have a knack at following me.

						<h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
						<p>
							I am Shivam Tyagi, I am 21 years old, I graduated with an honors degree (Mathematics) from Delhi University (DU) in 2021.
							Being logically and technically oriented, I enjoy solving problems and puzzles.
							As a fresher to the industry, I bring in enthusiasm and energy, the skills I have learned, and a willingness to keep learning.
							
							<br><br>

							I had heard a lot about AI & Data but it was only after having a conversation with someone who is working in the industry
							that I realized I'd love to work in this industry because it puts together 
							
							<p class="align-center">

									<i>What I have studied [Mathematics]</i> <br>
									<i>What I enjoy [Programming] &nbsp; &</i> <br>
									<i>What I am good at [Communication]</i> <br>

							</p>


							This interest led me to go for formal training from one of the reputed organizations in this domain - Ivy Pro School,
							a few months after my College Finals were over. The training is still ongoing along with a Host of Projects & Internships.

								<h3><b>Interests & Hobbies</b></h3>
								<p>

							<!--Speaking-->
							<h3><u>Speaking</u></h3>
							<p>
								Public Speaking. For some odd reason, I have been very interested in Public Speaking since I was a child, I was fascinated by those
								who could convey themselves effectively. Though, I was not born with it. Not even a wee bit.
								Though, there were many, but the most tangible pointers in bringing about this change were:

								<p class="align-center">
									<i>Delhi</i> <br>
									<i>Conor Neill</i><br>
									<i>Toastmasters Club</i><br>
									<i>Taking Personal Responsibilty</i>
								</p>

								Moving further, I have plans to get better at Story-Telling, they are pure gold as they convey
								so much while respecting the audience and letting them come to their own conclusions. 
								Everyone seems to love stories, and well why should we not, after all, it's the stories that makes us human.  
							</p>


							<!--Writing-->
							<h3><u>Writing</u></h3>
								<p>
									Today, I enjoy writing and I write on a regular basis (though haven't yet published anything, anywhere)
									but this was not the case throughout my life, I never felt it was for me.
									It was only when I was trying to get better at speaking, that 
									I felt the need for penning down my ideas. 
									<br><br>
									I write on tech, politics, economy, personal experiences and whatever else appeals to me.
									
								</p>


							

							<!--Programming - Problem Solving - Sudoku-->
							<h3><u>Problem Solving</u></h3>
							<p>
								I do not add this here to impress my employers, though I'm happy that they value this skill. I am
								very drawn towards solving puzzles, problem. Whenever I find interesting questions these days, 
								I like to build codes to solve it. Most recently I found this interesting question:

								<p class="align-center">
									<i> "Find a set of 6 integers in A.P. all of which are less than 1000 and are prime."</i>
								</p>

								Beyond solving such random questions, I enjoy playing Sudoku (Personal Best - 5:12) and plan on picking up
								Rubik's Cube in the days to come.
							</p>	

								<!--Harry Potter-->
							<h3><u>& The Mandatory - Harry Potter</u></h3>
							<br>
								<p>
									You can ask me anything under the sun about this story, I can talk about it all day and would not be tired 
									if asked to repeat it all over again the next day. I am not a know-it-all but I am on my way.
									<br><br>
									<b>Favorite Character? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Professor Severus Snape.

									<br>

									<b>Who do I resemble? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Harry Potter or Tom Riddle <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
									How?? Well, Knowledge and Ability in "Python" makes me a Parseltongue*.

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3><b>What am I looking forward to?</b></h3>
								<p>
									Plenty, actually. I'll divide it into the areas of Professional & Personal growth.
									<br>
									<u><h3>Profesionally :</h3></u>
								<p>
									In the near-future,
									I am looking forward to building a career in the field of Data.
									By the end of 2023, I have plans on becoming AWS certified. 
									I wish to learn in-depth about basic programming languages (C or C#) & DL Algorithms.

									<br><br>

									Later on,
									there's a good chance that I might go for an MBA.
									I might work independently, start a company, or turn into a consultant. Time will tell.
									I see myself working in the field of Data for many years to come.
								</p>
									<br>
									<u><h3>Personally :</h3></u>
								<p>
									I plan on working up a few hobbies in the years to come:
									<ol>
										<li>athletics</li>
										<li>playing guitar</li>
										<li>cooking (maybe!)</li>
									</ol>
										 
									I would love to get myself a dog.  Besides all that, I might as well, start writing a blog.
